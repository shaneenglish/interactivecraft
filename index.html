	<p>College Point's sewer system is set for a massive, four-year overhaul to meet current New York City Department of Environmental Protection guidelines. The revamped sewer system will limit the amount of wastewater that floods the streets and runs off into Flushing Bay during heavy rainfall. Residents are happy the sewers will prevent wastewater but are concerned about the length and quality of the construction, which is set to begin before the end of 2015.</p>
	<p>According to the New York City Department of Design and Construction, College Point is currently served by a combined sewer system where storm runoff and wastewater flow through the same system of pipes. "During heavy rainfall," the NYC DDC's proposal notes, the sewer system can be overloaded "causing untreated combined sewage and storm water to overflow."</p>
	<p>Joe Femenia, president of the College Point Civic and Taxpayers Association, is more blunt. "When we get heavy rain," he said, "it means that all that human waste is backing up in the street."</p>
	<p>The New York City Department of Design and Construction's plan will correct this problem. According to Senator Tony Avella, who spoke about the project at the CPCTA's September meeting, these changes will not solve all of College Point's flooding issues but will help to ensure that only storm water overflows from the sewers during heavy rain.</p>
	<p>"The sanitary sewer pipes have to go directly to the treatment system" under the NYC EPA's current guidelines, Avella said. This separation will prevent storm run off from being able to fill the sewers and push wastewater into the streets, he said. The NYC DDC's plan confirms Avella's statements.</p>
	<p>Lifelong resident, Joe Bux, 79, said that it will be great to have new sewers. He said that he recalls pools of dirty water stagnating in potholes and low lying streets after heavy rain. Bux did not seem particularly worried when asked about the length of the construction.</p>
	<p>Doris Scheer, 81, was more concerned about the construction. She said that the last time the city tore up the streets it was a mess. After the city replaced a sewer last year at 22nd Avenue between College Point Boulevard and 123rd Street, "they put blacktop in and it wasn't done well,"she said. "Someone fell because of the uneven street surface."</p>
	<p>"It's a good thing," Femenia said. "But there's going to be a lot of construction." He seemed resigned to the upgrade but echoed the worry of Scheer.</p>
	<p>Local marine biologist James Cervino said, in an interview with the Queens Times Ledger, that the new sewer system will improve the health of Flushing Bay by preventing excess nitrates from raw sewage from entering the water.</p>
	<p>Speaking to the Queens Chronicle, Cervino said that the benefits of a healthy bay go beyond the scientific and that a healthy eco system will prevent the bay from smelling like rotten eggs.</p>
